Introduction
Neural style transfer on images begins with using a pre-trained deep neural network, known as VGG19, to extract style and content information from the input images. By preserving the content features from the content image and the style features from the style image, a new image is generated that exhibits the content of the content image in the style of the style image in a visually appealing way. This process leverages the power of convolutional neural networks and iterative optimization algorithms to achieve impressive artistic transformations.
